s3n10r is a sandbox-like 2.5D RPG. Which means that it doesn’t have any 
clear plot like other RPG. But this game supports external plot which can be
triggered occasionally or by condition.

The game is developed with libSDL. It’s pixel styled (aka 8-bits styled) and
it's kind like Pokemon.

The game is based on my real life EXCEPT a built-in plot that is not real
happened to me. In this game you will roleplay as a senior high student and
do what a student does. Attend classes, take exams, social activities, and
discover the world around you.
